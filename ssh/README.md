## SSH

SSH is a protocol that allows you to connect to a remote computer. It is a secure protocol that uses encryption to protect the data that is sent to and from the remote computer. SSH is often used to connect to a remote computer's command line interface (CLI). This allows you to run commands on the remote computer. SSH can also be used to transfer files between computers using the SCP protocol.
